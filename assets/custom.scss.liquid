Notes from Joe: 

You'll develop your own style over time, below is how I would write this.

You might have custom CSS files get to thousans of lines of code, blocking like this will help.

/*==============
	GLOBAL
==============*/
h2 { // Most sites won't add a .h2 class for an h2 element, it's redundant. Some themes might, so you can control either way but I would target the element when you can.
  color: red; 
}



/*==============
	PRODUCT
==============*/

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) { // Note: I always include "screen" on these.

  /* Hide social share widgets on mobile */
  .social-sharing {
    display: none;
  }
  
}

/* You don't need to comment everything, I just did here to show style example I use.
